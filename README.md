# Self-_drivring_-car_pytorch
REINFORCEMENT AND DEEP Q-LEARNING ARE THE HEARTS OF ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE..AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO ILLUSTRATE THE STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGIES CONFLUENCING THAN THE SELF DRIVING CARS.
## ABOUT THE REPO
THE REPO CONSISTS OF TWO FILES:\
1.track.py(the path visualizeer made with kivy and matplotlib)\
2.ai.py(the algo for the deep q and neural net for the car made on the backbone of pytorch)\
## IMPORTANT LIBRARIES
1.PyTorch\
2.Kivy(UI dev module)\
3.Matplotlib\
4.Numpy
